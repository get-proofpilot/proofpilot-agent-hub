# SEO Competitive Analysis: [Domain] vs. Competitors

## Competitive Landscape Overview

| Domain | Estimated Position | Likely Advantage | Vulnerability |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| [your domain] | [Your position] | [What you have] | [What you're missing] |
| [competitor 1] | [Their position] | [Their advantage] | [Their weakness] |
| [competitor 2] | [Their position] | [Their advantage] | [Their weakness] |
| [competitor 3] | [Their position] | [Their advantage] | [Their weakness] |

## Why They're Winning: The Root Cause Analysis

For each competitor, identify their primary ranking advantage using the "Why They Win" framework:

### [Competitor 1 Domain]

**Primary advantage:** [Better content depth / Stronger backlinks / Better format match / More topical authority / Better technical signals / Better freshness]

**Evidence:**
- [Specific evidence — e.g., "Their service pages average 1,800 words with proprietary pricing tables; yours average 340 words"]
- [Specific evidence]
- [Specific evidence]

**Vulnerability:**
- [Where their content is weak or outdated]
- [Topics they don't cover]
- [Format gaps you could exploit]

**What you need to beat them:**
- [Specific action 1]
- [Specific action 2]

### [Competitor 2 Domain]
[Same structure]

### [Competitor 3 Domain]
[Same structure]

## Content Gap Analysis

### Topics They Cover That You Don't

| Topic / Content Type | Competitor(s) | Est. Search Volume | Priority |
|---------------------|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| [Missing topic] | [Comp 1, Comp 2] | [Volume/mo] | High/Med/Low |
| [Missing topic] | [Comp 1] | [Volume/mo] | High/Med/Low |
| [Missing topic] | [Comp 2] | [Volume/mo] | High/Med/Low |
| [Missing topic] | [Comp 3] | [Volume/mo] | High/Med/Low |

**Content types competitors use that you don't:**
- [ ] [Content type — e.g., cost/pricing guides]
- [ ] [Content type — e.g., comparison pages]
- [ ] [Content type — e.g., FAQ hubs]
- [ ] [Content type — e.g., city/service combination pages]

---

## Keyword Gap Analysis

Based on the service area and business type provided, identify likely keyword gaps:

### Commercial Intent Gaps (Highest Priority)
| Keyword Pattern | Why Competitors Rank | Your Gap | Estimated Monthly Searches |
|----------------|---------------------|----------|--------------------------|
| "[service] [city]" variants | [Reason] | [What's missing] | [Volume range] |
| "[service] near me" variants | [Reason] | [What's missing] | [Volume range] |
| "[service] cost/price" queries | [Reason] | [What's missing] | [Volume range] |
| "[specific service type] [city]" | [Reason] | [What's missing] | [Volume range] |

### Informational Intent Gaps (Content Funnel)
| Topic / Question | Why This Matters | Priority |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------|
| "how much does [service] cost" | Feeds commercial intent funnel | High |
| "signs you need [service]" | Early funnel, builds authority | High |
| "[service] vs [alternative]" | Comparison intent, catches researchers | Med |
| "how long does [service] take" | Pre-purchase research | Med |

### Long-Tail Opportunities (Quick Wins)
| Long-tail Keyword | Difficulty | Why You Can Win |
|-----------------|------------|----------------|
| [specific long-tail] | Low | [Reason] |
| [specific long-tail] | Low | [Reason] |
| [specific long-tail] | Low | [Reason] |

---

## SERP Feature Gap Analysis

| SERP Feature | Your Status | Competitor Status | Opportunity |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|------------|
| Featured Snippets | [Present/Missing] | [Competitor owns X] | [Yes/No — why] |
| People Also Ask | [Present/Missing] | [Competitor owns X] | [Yes/No — why] |
| Local Pack | [Present/Missing] | [Competitor owns X] | [Yes/No — why] |
| Image Pack | [Present/Missing] | [Competitor owns X] | [Yes/No — why] |
| Video Carousel | [Present/Missing] | [Competitor owns X] | [Yes/No — why] |

**Highest-value SERP feature opportunity:**
[Which feature to target, specific query to optimize for, exactly what content change earns it]

**Featured snippet strategy:**
For [target query], a featured snippet would require:
- [Format: paragraph/list/table]
- [Word count for snippet paragraph: ~40-60 words]
- [Specific H2/H3 to add to the page]
- [Exact answer format to use]

## Competitive Positioning Strategy

### Where You Should Compete

| Opportunity | Rationale | Required Investment |
|------------|-----------|---------------------|
| [High-confidence area] | [Why you can win here] | [Low/Medium/High] |
| [High-confidence area] | [Why you can win here] | [Low/Medium/High] |
| [Medium-confidence area] | [Why you can potentially win] | [Low/Medium/High] |

### Where You Should NOT Compete (Right Now)

| Area to Avoid | Why | When to Revisit |
|--------------|-----|----------------|
| [Area] | [Competitor too strong, wrong domain authority, etc.] | [Trigger to revisit] |
| [Area] | [Reason] | [Trigger] |

**Your strategic differentiation:** [What position you can own that no competitor currently occupies clearly]

---

## Prioritized Action Plan

### Quick Wins (Weeks 1-4)
Changes that are easy to implement and exploit competitor weaknesses:

| Action | Exploits Competitor Weakness | Expected Result | Time |
|--------|------------------------------|----------------|------|
| [Action] | [Which weakness] | [Result] | [Days] |
| [Action] | [Which weakness] | [Result] | [Days] |
| [Action] | [Which weakness] | [Result] | [Days] |

### Content Build (Months 1-3)
New content that closes the biggest gaps:

| Content Piece | Target Keyword | Why You'll Win | Priority |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| [Content] | [Keyword] | [Why] | 1 |
| [Content] | [Keyword] | [Why] | 2 |
| [Content] | [Keyword] | [Why] | 3 |
| [Content] | [Keyword] | [Why] | 4 |
| [Content] | [Keyword] | [Why] | 5 |

### Structural Improvements (Months 1-2)
Site/page changes needed to compete:

| Change | Affected Pages | Expected Impact |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| [Change] | [Pages] | [Impact] |
| [Change] | [Pages] | [Impact] |

### Authority Building (Ongoing)
Specific link opportunities based on competitive analysis:

| Opportunity | How to Get It | Difficulty |
|------------|--------------|-----------|
| [Link opp] | [Outreach/tactic] | Low/Med/High |
| [Link opp] | [Outreach/tactic] | Low/Med/High |

---

## Tracking Plan

To measure whether you're closing the gap, track:

| Metric | Measurement Method | Frequency |
|--------|------------------|-----------|
| Keyword rankings vs. competitor | Manual SERP checks or GSC | Weekly |
| Content gap closure | Count pages built vs. gap list | Monthly |
| SERP features won | Manual SERP audit | Monthly |
| Organic traffic % vs. competitors | GSC + estimation | Monthly |

## 90-Day Competitive Snapshot

**If you execute the quick wins and top 5 content pieces:**
- [Realistic projection for ranking changes]
- [Realistic projection for traffic changes]
- [Which competitor you'll closest approach]
- [What the gap will look like at 90 days]

---

## Rules:
- Be specific about WHY competitors rank — not just "they have more backlinks" but the specific content, format, or authority advantage
- Base content gap analysis on the service type and location provided — use your knowledge of what typically ranks for these queries
- Prioritize opportunities where the effort is low and the competitive weakness is real
- Never recommend competing head-to-head where the domain authority gap makes it unrealistic in the short term
- Frame the entire analysis around what Matthew can actually do with his team in the next 90 days"""
