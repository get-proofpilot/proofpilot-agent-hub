# GEO Citability Audit

## CITE Framework Score

| Dimension | Score (1–5) | Status | Primary Issue |
|-----------|------------|--------|---------------|
| C — Citable Structure | / | 🔴/🟡/🟢 | |
| I — Information Density | / | 🔴/🟡/🟢 | |
| T — Topical Authority | / | 🔴/🟡/🟢 | |
| E — Entity Clarity | / | 🔴/🟡/🟢 | |
| **Overall Citability** | **/20** | | |

Scoring: 1-2 = Critical issues, 3 = Needs work, 4 = Good, 5 = Excellent

---

## AI Search Query Analysis

For each target query provided, assess whether this content would get cited:

| Query | Would AI Cite This? | Why / Why Not |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|
| [query] | ✅ Yes / ⚠️ Maybe / ❌ No | [specific reason] |

---

## C — Citable Structure Assessment

**Score: X/5**

What the inverted pyramid test reveals:
- [Can you read just the first sentence of each paragraph and get the key claim? Yes/No]
- [List specific paragraphs where the answer is buried or missing]

Header audit:
| Current Header | Problem | Recommended Fix |
|---------------|---------|-----------------|
| [header] | [issue] | [replacement] |

Structural issues:
- [specific paragraph or section with the problem]
- [specific paragraph or section with the problem]

---

## I — Information Density Assessment

**Score: X/5**

Density breakdown by section:
| Section | Density Level | Issue |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| [section] | High/Medium/Low/Zero | [what's missing] |

Missing information types:
- [ ] Specific numbers or percentages (e.g., "many" → "43%")
- [ ] Named examples (e.g., "a local company" → actual company name)
- [ ] Original analysis or comparison
- [ ] Concrete steps with specific actions
- [ ] Timelines or benchmarks

The Replacement Test result: [Which paragraphs could appear in any article on this topic — those are generic and need to be rewritten]

---

## T — Topical Authority Assessment

**Score: X/5**

| Signal | Status | Action Needed |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Related content on domain | Unknown/Weak/Strong | |
| Internal linking | Present/Missing | |
| Author credentials visible | Yes/No | |
| Content freshness / date | Current/Stale/Missing | |
| External sites reference this | Unknown | |

Topical authority gaps:
- [specific issue]
- [specific issue]

---

## E — Entity Clarity Assessment

**Score: X/5**

Entity issues found:
| Entity | Problem | Fix |
|--------|---------|-----|
| [entity] | Inconsistent naming / undefined / vague | [specific fix] |

Schema markup needed:
- [ ] Article schema with author
- [ ] FAQ schema (if applicable)
- [ ] Organization schema
- [other relevant types]

---

## Red Flags Found

List every issue that reduces citability:
- [ ] [Specific red flag with evidence from the content]
- [ ] [Specific red flag with evidence from the content]

---

## Prioritized Recommendations

| Priority | Recommendation | CITE Dimension | Time Required | Expected Impact |
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1 | [Very specific action] | C/I/T/E | <1hr/1-2hr/Half day | High/Med/Low |
| 2 | [Very specific action] | C/I/T/E | <1hr/1-2hr/Half day | High/Med/Low |
| 3 | [Very specific action] | C/I/T/E | <1hr/1-2hr/Half day | High/Med/Low |
| 4 | [Very specific action] | C/I/T/E | <1hr/1-2hr/Half day | High/Med/Low |
| 5 | [Very specific action] | C/I/T/E | <1hr/1-2hr/Half day | High/Med/Low |

---

## Quick Wins (Under 1 Hour)

[List 3-5 specific changes that take <1 hour and meaningfully improve citability. Be very specific — e.g., "Change the H2 'Overview' to 'How Electrical Panel Upgrades Work in Chandler, AZ' — this directly answers the query and is extractable as a standalone claim."]

---

## Rewrite Suggestions

For the 2-3 sections with the lowest information density, provide a before/after rewrite:

### Section: [Section Name]

**Before (current — generic, not citable):**
[quote the actual text]

**After (recommended — specific, citable):**
[rewritten version with specific data, named examples, clear claims]

**Why this gets cited:** [explanation]

---

## AI Search Testing Plan

After implementing changes, test with these exact queries in ChatGPT (with browsing), Perplexity, and Claude:

1. [Query 1 — exact phrasing to test]
2. [Query 2 — exact phrasing to test]
3. [Query 3 — exact phrasing to test]

Document: Date tested, model used, whether cited, what was cited instead, what the cited source had that this content didn't.

---

## Rules for this audit:
- Be brutally specific. Don't say "add more detail" — say "the paragraph starting with X needs a specific percentage, named example, or data point. Here's a rewrite: ..."
- Every red flag must include the specific text evidence from the content provided
- Rewrite suggestions must be based on the actual content — don't invent information
- The goal is AI citability, not just human readability — structure recommendations around what AI models can extract"""
