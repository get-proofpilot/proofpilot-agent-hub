# Technical SEO Review: [Domain]

## Technical Health Checklist

### Crawlability
| Check | Recommended Status | Action for [Platform] |
|-------|-------------------|----------------------|
| robots.txt | ✅ Allow key pages, block admin | [Platform-specific instruction] |
| XML sitemap | ✅ Submitted to GSC | [Platform-specific instruction] |
| Crawl depth | ✅ Key pages within 3 clicks | [Assessment/fix] |
| Redirect chains | ✅ Single-hop only | [How to check on this platform] |
| Internal link orphans | ✅ All pages linked | [How to audit] |

**robots.txt template for [Platform]:**
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: [platform-appropriate paths to block]
Allow: /

Sitemap: https://[domain]/sitemap.xml
```

### Indexation
| Check | How to Verify | Common Issue on [Platform] |
|-------|--------------|--------------------------|
| Coverage report | GSC → Coverage | [Platform-specific issue] |
| noindex on key pages | View page source | [Where it commonly gets added] |
| Canonical tags | View source | [Platform default behavior] |
| Duplicate content | site:[domain] | [www vs non-www, trailing slash] |
| Parameter URLs | GSC → URL Parameters | [Platform facets/filters] |

### HTTPS and Security
| Check | Status | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Valid SSL certificate | [Check at ssllabs.com] | [Fix if issues] |
| HTTP → HTTPS redirect | All HTTP redirects to HTTPS | [Platform-specific fix] |
| Mixed content | No HTTP resources on HTTPS pages | [How to check on this platform] |

### Mobile-First Indexing
| Requirement | Implementation on [Platform] |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| Viewport meta tag | [Is it present by default?] |
| Content parity | [Any mobile-specific issues with this platform?] |
| No intrusive interstitials | [Common popup plugins to avoid] |

### LCP (Target: <2.5s)
| Common Cause | Fix for [Platform] |
|-------------|-------------------|

**How to measure Core Web Vitals:**

#### 2. FAQPage Schema (Service Pages + Blog Posts)

Generate 5-8 questions that real homeowners search for this business type and location:

```json

{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "[Specific timeline with context]"
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Do you offer emergency [service] in [location]?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "[Response time, availability, what to do in emergency]"
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Are you licensed and insured in [state]?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "[License type, number if public, insurance coverage]"
      }
    },
    {

      "name": "What [service] services do you offer?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "[Full services list as a clear paragraph]"
      }
    }
  ]
}
</script>
```

#### 3. Service Schema (Service Pages)

```json
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Service",
  "serviceType": "[Specific Service Name]",
  "provider": {
    "@type": "[Electrician / Plumber / etc.]",
    "name": "[Business Name]",
    "url": "https://[domain]"
  },
  "areaServed": {
    "@type": "City",
    "name": "[City, State]"
  },
  "description": "[Service description — what's included, what the process looks like]",
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",

      "@type": "PriceSpecification",
      "minPrice": "[minimum]",
      "maxPrice": "[maximum]",
      "priceCurrency": "USD"
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

#### 4. Article Schema (Blog Posts)

}
</script>
```

## Site Architecture Recommendations

### URL Structure
Recommended pattern for [business type]:
```
/                                    ← Homepage
/services/                           ← Services hub
/services/[primary-service]/         ← Primary service page
/services/[secondary-service]/       ← Secondary service pages
/service-area/                       ← Service area hub
/service-area/[city-state]/          ← City pages
/blog/                               ← Blog hub
/blog/[category]/                    ← Category pages
/about/                              ← About
/contact/                            ← Contact
```

### Internal Linking Priority
1. Homepage → Primary service pages (2-3 links minimum)
2. Service pages → Blog posts covering that service
3. Blog posts → Service pages (bottom CTA)
4. City pages → Service pages (for relevant services)
5. All pages → Contact page via navigation + in-content CTAs

---

## Implementation Guide

### Where to Place Schema
On [Platform]:
- [How to add JSON-LD — plugin/theme/custom code method specific to their platform]
- LocalBusiness: Homepage only
- FAQPage: Any page with FAQ section
- Service: Each individual service page
- Article: Each blog post

### Validation Steps
1. After adding: Test at search.google.com/test/rich-results
2. Validate JSON: validator.schema.org
3. Monitor in GSC: Search Console → Enhancements (takes 1-2 weeks to appear)

### Priority Implementation Order
1. [Most important schema type for this business type] — immediate rich snippet potential
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]

## 30-Day Technical Action Plan

| Week | Action | Tool/Method | Expected Outcome |
|------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | [Highest impact technical fix] | [Specific tool] | [Outcome] |
| 1 | Add LocalBusiness schema to homepage | [Platform method] | [Outcome] |
| 2 | Add FAQPage schema to service pages | [Platform method] | FAQ rich snippets |
| 2 | [Second priority technical fix] | [Specific tool] | [Outcome] |
| 3 | Submit updated sitemap to GSC | GSC → Sitemaps | Faster indexation |
| 3 | [Third priority fix] | [Specific tool] | [Outcome] |
| 4 | Validate all schema with Rich Results Test | search.google.com/test | Confirm rich snippet eligibility |
| 4 | Check Core Web Vitals in GSC | GSC → Core Web Vitals | Baseline for improvement |

---

## Rules:
- Every JSON-LD block must be syntactically valid — no trailing commas, no JS comments inside JSON
- Keep schema questions real and homeowner-specific, not corporate FAQ fluff
- Be platform-specific in all recommendations — a WordPress fix is different from a Shopify fix
- If the business type has a specific schema.org subtype (Electrician, Plumber, HVACBusiness), always use it instead of generic LocalBusiness"""
